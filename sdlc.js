// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// 1. Planning
// 2. Analysis of Requirements
// 3. Design
// 4. Implementation
// 5. Testing & Integration
// 6. Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning =
  "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added.";
const analysisOfRequirements =
  "This is the second step, where you are gathering information from the client requirements for the product. The team will discuss eatch detail and spec of the product. The goal of this stage is for everyone to understand even the minor details.";
const design =
  "This is the third step. At this stage, the team will decide how the project will be designed. The developer will select the programming lanaguage. Once the design and language has been decided, the stakeholders will review and provide feedback.";
const implementation =
  "This is the forth step. This is where the coding begins. The developer will turn ideas and design into computer language. This is typically the longest process.";
const testingIntegration =
  "This is the fifth step. Once the developers have finished building the software, the program will be deployed to the testing enviroment. The QA team will test the functionality of the entire program. If a bug is found, the QA team will communicate to the developers. This is repeated until the program is bug-free. Once this is done, the program will be deployed for delivery.";
const maintain =
  "This is the sixth step. This is where the custoemr starts using the developed system. The software will continue to get updates and maintained based on the user's enviroment, technology, and requirements.";
